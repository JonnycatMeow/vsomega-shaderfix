[goto:ata/G2_1][music:Bittersweet Goodbyes][dialoguesound:soundbytes/gf]Hey, it's okay! I'm sure it's somewhere in there, don't cry!
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/omega]Did you two find it?
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/mika][goto:ata/G2_2][nofade]No m-mister... It wasn't in there, we looked all over..
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/omega]Damn it, we'll have to start looking again.
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/gf][nofade]But we did find something!
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/bf]Beep?
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/gf][goto:ata/G2_3]I'm not sure how it works, but I think we can use it to finally get out of here!
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/bf]Beep bap!
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/omega]Well, that's good at least. I'm glad that you two found what you were looking for.
[nofade][goto:ata/G2_4]Thanks for the help, rat boy. We really would've been in trouble if you hadn't decided to work with us.
How about one last song for the road, eh? To remember us by.
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/bf]Beep bap!
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/omega]Sounds good! Y'all be safe, alright?
