[goto:Pre_1][music:Firefly][dialogueshadow:#ae86db][dialoguesound:soundbytes/omega]We've been walking a while, are you feeling tired?
[dialogueshadow:#84b8e8][dialoguesound:soundbytes/mika]A little bit, yeah.
[dialogueshadow:#ae86db][dialoguesound:soundbytes/omega]If you'd like, you could ride on my shoulder the rest of the way.
[dialogueshadow:#84b8e8][dialoguesound:soundbytes/mika]No thanks, Mister, I think I'll be okay.
[dialogueshadow:#ae86db][dialoguesound:soundbytes/omega]You sure? I don't mind it, y'know
[dialogueshadow:#84b8e8][dialoguesound:soundbytes/mika]I'm sure! We're almost there anyways, right?
