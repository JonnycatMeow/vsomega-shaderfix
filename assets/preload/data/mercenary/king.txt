[goto:kingquarters/k_1][music:Your Highness][sound:portalClose][dialogueshadow:#f54295][dialoguesound:soundbytes/gf]Ow… what did you do this time?
[dialogueshadow:#588ee0][dialoguesound:soundbytes/bf]Bop!
[goto:kingquarters/k_2][dialogueshadow:#f54295][dialoguesound:soundbytes/gf]Well, guess we gotta find a way out of this, don’t we
I’ll ask around, just, don’t go anywhere.
[dialogueshadow:#000000][goto:kingquarters/k_3][dialoguesound:soundbytes/queen]Oh dear, what can we do? All the mercenaries we sent out have failed.
[goto:kingquarters/k_4][dialoguesound:soundbytes/king]We'll have to resort to the royal army, it may be the only way to get her back.
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/queen]And if we don't?
[dialoguespeed:0.05][dialoguesound:soundbytes/king]Then the world is doomed as we know it.
[nofade][goto:kingquarters/k_5][dialoguesound:soundbytes/queen]Oh! A young lad! Perhaps this complete stranger that we’ve never met before could be the answer to all our problems!
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/king]Yes! How convenient!
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/queen]Almost as convenient as the time that you got a discount Priest from Headslist!
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/king]Oh yes! That was very convenient indeed!
[dialogueshadow:#588ee0][dialoguesound:soundbytes/bf]Beep.
[dialogueshadow:#000000][dialoguesound:soundbytes/queen]Oh! How rude of me! Dearest, could you explain to the boy the situation? He's obviously interested in helping.
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/king]Of course, Dear.
[goto:kingquarters/k_6]You see, boy, our only daughter was kidnapped! We believe that she’s being taken to the mountains out west.
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/queen]Yes, out west, where dangerous beasts reside…
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/king]Such as the Ursiapes.
[dialoguesound:soundbytes/queen]Such violent creatures...

Can I trust you with that?
