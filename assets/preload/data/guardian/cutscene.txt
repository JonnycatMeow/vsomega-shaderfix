[goto:childprotectiveservices/1][music:Defender][dialoguesound:soundbytes/omega]You don't get it, you don’t know the full story. You don't know what she's been through, what THEY’RE LIKE.
[goto:childprotectiveservices/2]They locked her away. Alone. Afraid.
[goto:childprotectiveservices/3][nofade]They did THAT to a CHILD.
[goto:childprotectiveservices/4]And for what? Because some stupid prophecy said that she was cursed? What sort of parenting IS that?
[goto:childprotectiveservices/5][nofade][dialoguesound:soundbytes/bf]Bop?
[goto:childprotectiveservices/6][dialoguesound:soundbytes/omega]It's not too late. You can help me. I can tell that you're powerful.
An army approaches from the east, with the same end goal that you have.
They're going to try and take her, to lock her up once again.
I doubt that I would be able to take them all out, but if we worked together, we could protect her.
[goto:childprotectiveservices/7][nofade]But if you're still set on taking her back yourself.
Be it for fame or riches.
Just know that I will NOT go down without a fight.
